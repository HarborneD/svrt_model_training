Curate SVRT images for 23 tasks

[X] train single model per task
[ ] train one model for many tasks


[X] try different model architectures
[X] try varying the amount of training data

[ ] use keras models and simple keras code VS interpretability framework code

Considerations:
[X] cross validation
[X] train - validation - test
[X] multiple trials and plot STD and Mean 
[ ] learning rate
[ ] Train to Convergence:
    [ ] early stop
    [ ] best model
